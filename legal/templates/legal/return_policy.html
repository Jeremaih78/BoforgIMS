    </div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Boforg Technologies supplies printing machinery, business equipment, consumables, and digital services. Because these products are technical and in many cases require setup, calibration, and operator training, this policy is designed to protect both the customer and Boforg Technologies.</p>

    <h2>Returns Accepted Only for Verified Defects</h2>
    <p>We accept returns only where the item is defective on arrival or has a verified manufacturing fault.</p>

    <h2>Returns Not Accepted For</h2>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>Change of mind / buyer's remorse</li>
      <li>Incorrect item ordered by the customer</li>
      <li>Lack of technical knowledge or failure to follow operating instructions</li>
      <li>Normal wear and tear</li>
      <li>Damage caused by misuse, mishandling, dropping, water exposure, dust, or negligence</li>
      <li>Damage caused by power surges, unstable electricity, incorrect voltage, or incorrect adapters</li>
      <li>Items that have been used for production, modified, opened beyond necessary inspection, or tampered with</li>
      <li>Consumables and perishables including inks, sublimation paper, vinyl, blanks (mugs, shirts, slates), chemicals, and accessories once opened</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Inspection Window (24 Hours)</h2>
    <p>Customers must inspect goods within 24 hours of delivery or collection. Any claim must be reported within this period with clear photos/videos and a description of the issue. Failure to report within 24 hours will be treated as acceptance of the goods in good condition.</p>

    <h2>Machines &amp; Technical Products</h2>
    <p>Machines are tested before dispatch. Many printing machines require setup and calibration and may need operator training. Operational difficulties, incorrect settings, or software/configuration issues are not considered defects. We provide guidance and support to help customers get running.</p>

    <h2>Remedy (Repair/Replacement First)</h2>
    <p>If a verified manufacturing defect exists, Boforg Technologies may, at its discretion:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>Repair the item, or</li>
      <li>Replace the faulty part, or</li>
      <li>Exchange the item for the same model (subject to availability)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>Refunds are only considered if the item cannot be repaired and a replacement is not available. If approved:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>Refunds are processed within 7-14 business days after the returned item passes inspection</li>
      <li>Shipping, handling, and transaction fees are non-refundable</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Return Process (How to Request)</h2>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>Contact us on WhatsApp or email with your order details</li>
      <li>Provide photos/videos and a short explanation</li>
      <li>Wait for return authorization before sending anything back</li>
      <li>Unauthorized returns will not be accepted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Return Shipping</h2>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>If the fault is verified as a manufacturing defect, we will advise the return method and responsibility for shipping based on the situation.</li>
      <li>If inspection shows no defect or the issue is caused by misuse/user error, the customer bears all shipping costs and no refund/exchange is due.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Training &amp; Digital Services</h2>
    <p>Payments for training, installation, consultation, software setup, website development, chatbots, and digital services are non-refundable once the service has been delivered, started, or scheduled.</p>
